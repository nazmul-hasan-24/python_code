Complex Numbers in Python
In Python, complex numbers are a built-in data type
used for mathematical computations involving imaginary
numbers. A complex number is represented as:

a + bj

a is the real part
b is the imaginary part
j represent âˆš-1 (the imaginary unit in Python, similar to 
i in mathematics).
