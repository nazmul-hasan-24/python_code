#There are three numeric types in Python:

#Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, 
#without decimals, of unlimited length.
a = 11 #int

#Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, 
# containing one or more decimals.
b = 3.4 #float

#Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
float_scientific = 13e5
print(float_scientific)
print(type(float_scientific))

#Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
c = 2j #complex
d = 4-5j
#varify type 
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
